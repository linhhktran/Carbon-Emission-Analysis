The study examines the extraction and processing of all upstream raw materials to produce the products and packaging components; the manufacturing process; distribution logistics; product use and packaging disposal. The work has been conducted using the Ecoinvent database and SimaPro software.  Climate change impacts are measured in kg CO2 equivalents, following the IPCC’s most recent methodology).  Scenario evaluations have been used to examine the importance of several variables in the product comparison. These include a range of possible consumer behaviours regarding the use of the products, such as conditions of refrigeration, washing of glasses, and disposal routes for packaging, among others."                                                                                   | 0.54167      | 0                    | 45.88                                            | 4.92                                             | 49.20                                            |
